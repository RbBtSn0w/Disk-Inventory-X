- directories which can not be listed (e.g. due to no permissions) are shown with size 0

- put the focus ring on the graphic area (hit <tab> key
  until the graphic area is highlighted), use the
  vertical frame/view resizing bar to make the graphic
  area larger/wider, then smaller/thinner, and observe.
  The blue focus/highlight is not erased after resizing,
  and leaves graphic artefacts on the window.
