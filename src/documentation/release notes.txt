release notes
=============

1.2 (2019-02-28)
----------------
new:
- please note that macOS 10.13 or later is required
- new application icon thanks to Anton Repponen
- tree map: the rendering is done in full resolution on Retina displays
- German, French and Spanish localization

bug fix:
- file outline view (left side):
  - the initial column widths are not quite optional (manual resizing needed)
  - file names show end ellipsis when the column is not wide enough to shw the full name

- various small bug fixes and improvements


1.2 beta 1 (2018-12-27)
------------------------

new:
- Disk Inventory X is now 64 Bit (Intel only ;-)
- support of macOS 10.11+ (including 10.14 Mojave)
- support for dark mode on 10.14
- project updated to Xcode 10

changed:
- Finder plugin removed as this kind of plugin is no longer supported by macOS

bug fix:
- when resizing the window on Retina displays the app unexpectedly quitted in most cases

known bugs/problems:
- folders which are loaded when the application is closed are reloaded next time the app is launched
- In dark mode, the edges of the drawers (kind statistic, selection list) are shown in the light color. Apple has declared drawers as depreciated and it seems Apple has not implemented the dark mode for drawers (this is just a visual flaw; they still work as expected).
- tree map: the rendering does not use the native resolution on Retina displays resulting in a kind of blurry tree map
- file outline view (left side):
  - the initial column widths are not quite optional (manual resizing needed) 
  - file names are not nicely truncated (showing the usual end ellipses) to fit the column width; they are just truncated at the right side of the column


vdev (2006-10-27)
------------------------

new features:
- Disk Inventory X and it's Finder menu plugin are now Universal Binaries (so they run natively on Intel and PowerPC/G5 based Macs).
- better collaboration and system integration:
  - You can now open files with new "Open" and "Open with..." commands.
  - support for system services (Menu "Services")
  - drag&drop support for files from Disk Inventory X to other applications (e.g. to open file with an application in the dock)

bug fixes:
- When performing "Move to trash" on a file/folder residing on a network volume, it was moved to .Trashes/.<user-id> on that volume, although a dialog warned the user that it will be deleted.
- fixed a crash on startup

1.0 (final) (2005-10-10)
------------------------

new features:
- Finder context menu plugin with a "Open in Disk Inventory X" command for folders and volumes (must be installed manually in the preference window!)
- a new selection list which can show all files of a specific kind or all all files (to show the selection list, use the new context menu in the kind statistic or select menu "Window->Selection List").
- an option whether the assignment between colors and file kinds are shared between open windows or not (so every kind has in all windows the same color - like before - or the assignment is done for each window separately)
- performance improvements when dealing with a large number of files
- sortable columns in the kind statistic drawer (and in the new selection list, of course)
- a warning is shown prior deleting a file or folder on a network volume (items on a network volume can only be deleted, not moved to trash)

bug fixes:
- DIX crashed when refreshing a file or files if DIX has zoomed into a folder
- the "select parent" shortcut did not work if the file view had the focus: the shortcut is now changed to Apple-U (previously Command-P).


1.0 beta (2004-06-12)
---------------------
- now runs only under Mac OS X 10.3+; 10.2 is no longer supported!

new features:
- the scanning process is now 3 times faster (thanks to Dave Payne from Apple)
- show the free space and the space occupied by not shown files (on the selected volume) and like a file in the treemap
- show physical (# of used clusters) or logical (size of content) file size
- ignore creator code (so all those PDF files are shown as "PDF File" and not as "Acrobat PDF File" or "PDF File")
- option to use a small font in the file list and the file kind statistic drawer
- refresh (reload) all or an individual file or folder
- preferences
- toolbar

The source code for the tree map is now a separate framework to be easily integrated into other applications.


0.8 (2004-03-18)
----------------
bug fixes:
- program hanged sometimes while scanning folder (reason: overwritten or deleted files)

new features:
- a "move to trash" command
- folders can be opened by dragging them on the application icon
- switch between vertical and horizontal splitting in the main window
- afrikaans translation by Marius van Wyk
- french translation by Daniel Girod
- german translation by me;-)
- small interface enhancements
- no more uncontrolled pouring of messages to console.log


0.7 (2004-03-07)
