Select any folder or volume which you would like to analyze. A window should open stating &quot;Loading bla bla&quot;. Please be patient if you have selected a large folder or a whole volume with lots of files and folders.<br>After the loading is completed (the progress window has closed) the main window should open where you see on the left half a finder-like view of the selected folder/volume and on the right half a graphical view:</p><p><img src="images/overview.jpg" width="862" height="452"></p><p>(1) This finder-like view shows the files and folders with their sizes.<br>  (2) The treemap shows the files and folders in a way that should easily made clear which files and folders occupy most of the space. The selection in the finder-like view and the treemap is synchronized. (Please read (4) for the meaning of the different colors.)<br>  (3) Here some information is displayed about the file pointed at in the treemap.<br>  (4) The file type statistic informs about the count of files of a specific type and the sum of their sizes. The list is sorted by size in descending order. Each type has a color which is also used in the treemap (2). The same color is used throughout all opened folders for each type (see below).</p><p>Through the &quot;View&quot; menu you can choose whether you would like to view package contents, you can zoom into folders and some more things which should help analyzing the disk usage.</p><h1>A word on the use of colors</h1><p>  Disk Inventory X has 12 predefined colors which are assigned to the 8 &quot;largest kinds&quot; (the idea behind this is that it's getting harder and harder to distinguish the colors if there are more than 12). <br>  The rest of the kinds are assigned to the grey color. This color assignment is made across all opened folders (the color assignment is shared) - files of the same kind have the same color in all opened folders. <br>  So if you load the first folder all 12 colors may be assigned to some kinds (if the folder contains files of at least 12 different kinds). If you now open a second folder with totally different file kinds, there are no more colors left and all kinds of the second folder are assigned to the grey color. <br>  The only way to reset the assignments is currently to restart DIX.</p></body></html>
